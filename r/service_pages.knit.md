#### Equity
*Baltimore City's Equity Assessment Program defines equity as closing the gaps in policy, practice, and allocation of City resources so that race, gender, religion, sexual orientations, and income do not predict one’s success, while also improving outcomes for all. Equality provides the same resources and opportunities to all, whereas equity recognizes there are institutional and structural barriers and provides everyone with what they need to thrive.* 

7. What specific disparities does this service seek to address? How does this service address these disparities?

The areas in which we provide services are open to the public and we welcome all Baltimore City residents and visitors alike to come and experience the Inner Harbor.  Our team members thrive to make it a clean and inviting place for all Baltimoreans to enjoy and we do this by our event we created this past summer called Baltimore by Baltimore.  This event was produced by local baltimore producers and all the talent and artists were local Baltimoreans as well.  The event was curated by producers but our WPB workforce development team was the main driving force and staff for all events.  In 2023 we are looking to grow the event to include even more and different groups with in the city and also include a youth based event as well.  The Inner Harbor hasn't had programming that was directed towards individuals from from lower income areas of the city like it did this past Summer.

8. What data is used to assess the service's impact on reducing these disparities?

For these events we had volunteers taking surveys of attendees to gather information on what part of the city they were fun and what they would like to see at future festivals and at the harbor as a whole.  We are using this information to see what cultures of the city residents we did not include in this years events and try to include them in this upcoming years festivals.

#### Resiliency
*Baltimore City's Sustainability Office defines resiliency as the ability of our community to anticipate, accommodate, and positively adapt to or thrive amidst changing climate conditions or hazard events and enhance quality of life, reliable systems, economic vitality, and conservation of resources for present and future generations.* 

9. Explain how this service adapts and adjusts in response to the changing needs of your end users. If possible, provide examples of how this service is doing this currently or has done this in the past.

    Our services are everchanging to the needs of the District.  We base our service levels on a variety of factors such as; time of year, events in the District, weather factors, and staffing levels.  If we are aware of a large event in the city, such as CIAA last February, we will be sure to deploy more cleaning and saftey team members to be sure they can handle the volume of trash and the influx of visitors to the area.  Time of year also impacts our service level becasue our end user (visitors) may or may not be frequenting the district; summer months means more people and winter is vice-versa.  In the summer months we have a different deploymemt that means more staff members and more living classroom foundation team members as well.  More people means more trash.  In the winter months we scale down and have a smaller staff due to the fact it is colder and not as many people visiting the Harbor.

Story Behind the Curve updated on Dec 16, 2022

**Staff hours for clean/safety teams** 

 Explain the factors that impacted the FY22 actual data.

 At the beginning of FY22 we were starting to come out of the pandemic and we were able to have a more reliable workforce.  Our staffing numbers were able to remain fairly consistent through out the year due to know spike in covid cases or budgetary reason that would mean we would need to reduce staff. We also raised our minimum wage for our front line staff to help retain our employees and eliminate the "revolving door" of staff members.

  Explain how the FY24 target was established.

 The FY24 target was established by our staffing levels that we were consistently hitting before the pandemic.  We also anticpate a small increase in service levels in the next 2 years with the addition of Rash Field but do not foresee any other staffing level increase.  That is why we did a slight increas over our pre-pandemic staffing goals.

**% of mystery shoppers reporting Area Clean/Free of Trash** 

 Explain the factors that impacted the FY22 actual data.

 This percentage number comes from an average of scores done by our third party district audit called a mystery shop done by Amusement Advantage Inc.  The "shopper" grades us on a variety of issues in the district including; area is clean of trash, trash cans are not 3/4 full, benches and walkways are clear of debris, and cigarette urns were in good repair. We receive 86 mystery shops per year and those shops are spread out to have more shops in the summer months (9) and less in the winter months (4).  We scored high in all those areas and that is why we were able to hit our target value of 96%

  Explain how the FY24 target was established.

 We kept the same target value for FY24 becasue this target is a realtively high target numner to hit.  Even though we hit it in FY22 it is still a difficult goal to reach.
